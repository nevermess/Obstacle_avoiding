# Obstacle_avoiding
This repository contains code written for building an autonomus Obstacle avoiding robot. Ultra sonic sensor is used to measure the distance of any obstacle present in the environment and the codes are written in Arduino. This robot is built in workshop conducted by EEE Association of National Institute of Technology Trichy (NIT-Trichy) for First year undergraduate students.

# Speciality of Robot
1. It detects obstacle in 180 degrees using single Ultra-sonic sensor over a servo motor.
2. It counts the number of obstacle/s in a particular direction and takes turn based on it.
3. If a sudden obstacle is introduced in it's direction of motion and the distace is less than a specified value then it goes backwards until that distance is achieved.
